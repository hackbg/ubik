***Ubik***, named after the mysterious "reality-restoring substance" from
[Philip K. Dick's eponymous novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik),
helps you restore compatibility, interoperability, and correctness when
building libraries in TypeScript.

What it does:

* Add missing extensions to TypeScript output.
* Add missing `/index.js` to directory imports.
* Separate undifferentiated `import`/`import type` within a package.
* Merge packages that were prematurely separated but ended up tightly coupled.
* Publish patched packages then restore your working tree to a pristine state.

## Quick start

Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@hackbg/ubik": "^2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "ubik": "ubik"
  }
}
```

Add to `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "exclude": [
    "dist/**/*"
  ]
}
```

Add to `.gitignore`:

```
dist/
*.dist.js
*.dist.mjs
*.dist.cjs
*.dist.d.ts
```

Now you can publish your library with `npm run ubik publish`.

## Basic premise

TypeScript wants you to import modules with:

```ts
import { foo } from "./foo"
```

but the ECMAScript specification expects:

```js
import { foo } from "./foo.js"
```

TypeScript doesn't add the extensions; it also doesn't provide an extensibility hook
which could be used to add them. [The documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/esm-node.html)
is confusing and unhelpful; the solution that it suggests is ridiculous and unacceptable.
On GitHub issues, the TypeScript developers have repeatedly reacted with indifference.

**Before Node.js 16, this was less of a problem:** imports without extensions still
worked. However, since Node 16 started enforcing the ES Modules spec (which requires
extensions), the code that `tsc` outputs became effectively **invalid and impossible to run**
(unless you were writing your program in a single file).

What, were you expecting the compiler for evertone's favorite "strict superset of JS"
to, idk, output correct JS that is ready to execute? You crazy person.

## Also goes well with...

When using Ubik alongside the [**`@hackbg/ganesha`**](https://github.com/hackbg/ganesha)
module loader for Node 16+, TypeScript on the backend becomes completely transparent:
no build step during development + monolithic publish step üêò
